How Do I Approach Designing Software?

  My Project for this class has given me the opportunity to understand how a project can take a while and how it can fall apart and come together. I had a lot of issues with the program as it went along so it gave me a good chance to work on my debugging skills. I also saw how a project can become a team effort through communicating with my professor about my issues. It allowed me to see how I can improve through the help of others. I also learned to work even earlier than I have been and to work longer than I have before. I tried to follow the idea of design a bit and test a bit. I also worked on the multiple iterations of changing a few numbers to make the images change and seeing how that would effect my images.
  
  
How Do I Approach Designing Programs?

  I dont know that I used different strategies but rather that I used different ways of trying the same techniques. I started to try and think of different ways to make the small things work. When I was looking at iterations, I had to form the images and try to make them stick. I had to do several iterations I also had to change small minute details to try and make things change so that the code would work the way that I wanted it to work. I have had to change my decisions and my approach each week. I had to decide when to start. I had to decide how long to let myself struggle. I had to figure out a way to fix what needed to be fixed.

How Can Computer Science Help Me in Reaching My Goals?

  Computational graphics to me has been one of the hardest classes I have had to take. I feel that course wise it will apply very little but the feeling of I can overcome this then I can overcome anything else will stick with me. I know that this shows me that I can do a project even if it gets hard for me. In regards to my professional Pathway, It shows me how to work with someone in a team. It teaches me I have a long way to go and that I have to ask people for help sometimes and that is okay because that helps me learn. It shows me that I can ask for help from someone in future company and use it as a learning experience rather than an I failed response.
